Technical test - QA Engineer
Overview
The objective of this technical test is to assess the candidates ability in both UI and API testing. There will be a technical assessment, as well as
an expectation of showing your logic, approach and thought-process.
What can I use?
We are fairly flexible on your approach and use of frameworks/languages, but here is a suggested list of what you could use:
Git
Visual Studio/Visual Studio Code
Postman
C#/Java/Javascript
Specflow/Cucumber
Expectations
Create a GitHub account (or use an existing one)
Create 2 Private Repositories - UI test and API test
Go to settings > manage access, and add qaleads@betwaygroup.com as a collaborator for both
Complete the questions below and commit code to the relevant repository
Be prepared to explain your approach and any technical concepts used
Think about how you would improve your tests if you were given more time
UI Test
Write test cases for the following scenarios:
Prerequisite for all scenarios: Navigate to *URL*
Feature: As a business user, I would like to make a record of all teams which are playing today
Scenario: Output all team names with a match today. If there are no matches today, output a message to convey this.
Feature: As a sports user, I would like to read about all articles related to sports
Scenario: Use the search option to find all articles related to ‘sports’. Output the first heading and the last heading returned on the page.
Feature: As a QA, I would like to verify all negative scenarios for login
Scenario: Select ‘Sign in’, and enter as many negative scenarios as possible. Verify that a error message is displayed and the text that it
contains is as expected.
API Test
API Endpoint: *ep URL*
Questions
Complete the following scenarios:
Make regular, atomic commits to the repositories, as this is not only best practice, but will help visualize your approach
Verify the HTTP status is 200
Count the total number of currencies returned within the response
Verify the currency ‘GBP’ is shown within the response
